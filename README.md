![cadCAD GPT - titleimg banner hello](https://github.com/TE-Academy/cadCAD-GPT/assets/42371947/86a4663b-ce48-40f5-b3ec-df8b6707fe6e)

cadCAD GPT is an open-source LLM agents framework to support token systems simulations. cadCAD GPT can be used on top of any Python model following the cadCAD/radCAD model structure. Via Python functions, it can integrate today’s most powerful data analysis and machine learning libraries (Tools) and can access data in various formats (Memory). Finally, cadCAD GPT allows users to control and track the agents’ workflow for verifiable and reproducible results.

## Quickstart

- In the examples folder, open the 0_template_folder. This has all the components to get started building your own chatbot.
- Copy your radcad code into the example_radcad.py file.
- Go to the example_project.ipynb file, paste your openAI key in the openai_key variable and run all the code. And you can start chatting with the cadcad_gpt chatbot now.
